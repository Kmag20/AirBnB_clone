                            <p>Fantastic place. it was clean , Adrienne was
                                great (even though we did not meet in person)
                                 and everything went super smooth. Location is
                                also great if you like running and something a bit more quiet. I would
                                suggest a car or take into consideration that you
                                might have to Uber into the city from the location.
                                 Overall, would recommend the place anytime.
